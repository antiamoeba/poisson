CS 284B Final Project: Cylindrical Panoramas

### TODO List ###

* Cylindrical warping (Rishi - Done)
* Spherical warping (Rishi - Done)
* Alignment with convolutions (Dorian - Done)
* Alignment with Image Pyramids (Dorian)
* Blending (both)

James's notes
* feature detection
* video while the camera is rotating
** alignment will be easier
* RANSAC to test correspondences
* at the end, do a single solve on the whole thing to close to loop
** assume drift is linear
* 360 view visualizer
* Ask his grad student Rachel

* don't take the average (blurry)
* in combining: take the average of the middle quartile
** take the median value, take 12.5% on either side, and average that 25%
